# ngTwenty

Welcome to the exciting new game 

Its easy...You just need to drag and drop a number on same number to make a new number (basically you are adding 1 to the number)
So 3 + 3 will make 4 and so on....

If you will reach till twenty then you win but if the rows reach to the top first then you loose :(

so lets play....
